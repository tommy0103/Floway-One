# Floway

Floway is a self-hosted LLM API gateway for coding agents and API clients. It
puts subscription-backed and token-backed model providers behind one gateway,
then routes each model through the API shape the client already speaks.

## Highlights

- Use GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT subscriptions, Claude.ai subscriptions, Azure AI,
  configurable multi-protocol HTTP providers, and Ollama from one deployment.
- Serve OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini-compatible, audio transcription, and rerank
  APIs with cross-protocol translation where needed.
- Discover vendor model catalogs live while retaining manual model configuration
  for providers that require or permit it.
- Manage upstreams, routing order, model aliases, API keys, and web search from
  a dashboard.
- Generate one-command Claude Code and Codex configurations from an API key.
- Run on Cloudflare Workers or Node.js, with Docker Compose provided for a
  self-hosted server and dashboard.

## Quick Start

Docker Compose is the shortest path to a complete local deployment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Menci/Floway.git
cd Floway
ADMIN_KEY='replace-with-a-secret' docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

Open <http://localhost:18088>, leave the username blank, and use `ADMIN_KEY` as
the password. Then:

1. Add at least one provider under **Providers → Upstreams**.
2. Create a key under **Services → API Keys**.
3. Give that key to a client as a bearer token or `x-api-key`, or use **Agent
   Setup** to configure Claude Code or Codex.

The data-plane and control-plane APIs are also exposed directly at
<http://localhost:8788>. SQLite, file-backed dump bodies, and oversized
Stateful OpenAI Responses item payloads persist in the `floway-data` volume.

The dashboard uses Floway's control plane to manage users, keys, upstreams,
routing, and telemetry. Coding agents and API clients call the data plane,
which performs model resolution, upstream dispatch, and any required protocol
translation. Both planes are served by the same gateway process.

## Compatibility

### Client APIs

| API | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Completions | `POST /v1/completions` |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| OpenAI Responses | `POST /v1/responses`, `POST /v1/responses/compact`, WebSocket `GET /v1/responses` |
| OpenAI Embeddings | `POST /v1/embeddings` |
| OpenAI Images | `POST /v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/images/edits` |
| OpenAI Audio Transcriptions | `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| OpenAI Models | `GET /v1/models`, `GET /models` |
| Anthropic Messages | `POST /v1/messages`, `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` |
| Google Gemini | `GET /v1beta/models`, `GET /v1beta/models/{model}`, `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`, `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent`, `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:countTokens` |
| Cohere Rerank v1 | `POST /v1/rerank` |
| Cohere Rerank v2 | `POST /v2/rerank` |
| Jina Rerank | `POST /jina/v1/rerank` |
| Voyage Rerank | `POST /voyage/v1/rerank` |

`/v1/models` and `/models` return Floway's public model superset to ordinary
callers and select the Codex or Claude Code discovery shape for those clients'
User-Agent.

Rerank models are manual Custom models. Each model selects its outbound Cohere,
Jina, Voyage, DashScope-compatible, or DashScope-native protocol and may
override that protocol's canonical path; there is no upstream-wide rerank path.

Audio transcription is a buffered multipart passthrough for Custom, Azure, and
Ollama-compatible upstreams. JSON, text, subtitle, and transcription SSE
responses retain their upstream wire shape.

### Upstreams

| Provider | Connection | Model catalog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Copilot | GitHub device OAuth on `github.com` or a `*.ghe.com` tenant | Fetched live from Copilot |
| Codex | ChatGPT subscription through the Codex CLI OAuth client | Live inference catalog plus the account's built-in GPT Image capability |
| Claude Code | Claude.ai Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise subscription through the Claude Code CLI OAuth client | Fetched live from Anthropic |
| Custom | Configurable multi-protocol HTTP endpoint, credential, and per-header ingress passthrough/overwrite rules | Live `/models` (OpenAI, Anthropic, or superset shapes), manual models, or both |
| Azure | Azure AI resource or Foundry project endpoint and API key | Configured models |
| Ollama | ollama.com or a self-hosted Ollama-compatible server | Fetched live from Ollama, with optional manual overrides |

## Other Deployment Options

### Cloudflare Workers

Requires Node.js 22.5+, pnpm 10.x, and a Cloudflare account.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm wrangler login
cp wrangler.example.jsonc wrangler.jsonc

# Follow the comments in wrangler.jsonc to create the required resources and
# replace every <YOUR_*> placeholder.
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run dev
```

The local dashboard runs at <http://localhost:5174>. For an agent-assisted
production deployment, invoke `$deploy-to-cloudflare`. It uses the established
update and rollback flow by default. A deployment named as new first runs an
isolated binding-probe bootstrap and requires its `Hello World` response before
publishing Floway.

For a manual production update, configure the admin secret, apply the remote
migrations, and deploy:

```bash
pnpm wrangler secret put ADMIN_KEY
pnpm run db:migrate:remote
pnpm run deploy
```

### Node.js

The Node.js target builds and serves the production Dashboard together with the
data-plane and control-plane APIs. It applies SQLite migrations automatically
and defaults to `./data/floway.db`, `./data/files`, and port `8788`:

```bash
pnpm install
ADMIN_KEY='replace-with-a-secret' pnpm run dev:node
```

The Dashboard and gateway share <http://localhost:8788>; no separate web server
or reverse proxy is required for this mode. The command rebuilds the Dashboard
before starting so it also works immediately after a clean checkout.
Production Node.js deployments must set both `NODE_ENV=production` and a
non-empty `ADMIN_KEY`.

Floway One's explicit personal profile instead binds only to
`http://127.0.0.1:8788` and stores its database, files, logs directory, and
`runtime.json` below the operating system's per-user application-data
directory:

```bash
ADMIN_KEY='replace-with-a-secret' pnpm run dev:one
```

Set `PORT` when deliberately moving the personal endpoint. The selected port
is persisted in `runtime.json`, and startup warns that configured AI clients
must be updated. A port conflict or inaccessible application-data directory
stops startup rather than selecting a fallback. Personal stdout and stderr are
also retained in size-bounded rotating files under the application-data logs
directory; ordinary Node server mode continues to use its existing console
behavior.

Podman users can instead follow the
[systemd deployment guide](./docker/systemd/README.md).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm run verify
```

`verify` chains every root verification script named by
`.github/workflows/verify.yaml`, reproducing that script set on the current
host. Pull requests additionally run the packaged Node verifier against Linux
Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager, and macOS Keychain to exercise
platform-specific credential storage, assembly, and startup paths. Each link is
also a script of its own, in the order the chain runs them: `typegen`, `lint`,
`typecheck`, `test`,
`test:installers`, `check:agents-md`, `check:generated-assets`,
`check:verify-parity`, `build:web`, and `test:packaged-node`. The build carries
the assertions about the emitted bundle, and the final check assembles an
isolated production Node runtime and executes its image command. `typegen` comes
first because the generated route types are not checked in and the lint
configuration is type-aware, so a fresh clone has to produce them before
anything else can read the dashboard's sources.
